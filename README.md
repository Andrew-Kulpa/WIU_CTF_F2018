# WIU_CTF_F2018


## Process:

  1. Each team finds a flag via the CTF.
  2. SSH into the relay GPIO emitter Raspberry Pi.
  3. Upon putting in the correct flag, their corresponding light is lit up.
  
## TO DO:

  - GPIO logic
  - Team specification
  - Code refactoring
  - Better README.md
  - Hacktoberfest issues for peer reviewing?
